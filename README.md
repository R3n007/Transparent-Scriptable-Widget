# There's something better waiting for you...
I wrote this script after a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSsetups/comments/j1o6v4/automatically_create_transparent_widgets_with/) ended up gaining more interest than I anticipated. However, I've since created [__Weather Cal__](https://github.com/mzeryck/Weather-Cal), which is much more flexible, has way more options, and is actively maintained.

I'm now archiving this repository, and will probably eventually make it private. Please go enjoy, fork, and contribute to Weather Cal!
